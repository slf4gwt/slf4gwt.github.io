## Description

The showcase provides you a simple way to see how the logging is working. Please open the browser console to see the console logging. Additionally and for convenience, we added the popup logger that displays a simple popup above the GWT application with all log messages in it.

You only need to click on the different log level buttons to generate a log message of named log level. <code>WARN</code> and <code>ERROR</code> log an exception, so you can see how this looks like in production code.
